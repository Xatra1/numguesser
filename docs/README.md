# Building from Source
To compile, open a terminal in the same directory as the makefile and run ``make``  
This will create an executable in ``src/deb/usr/local/bin/`` named ``numguesser``. It will also attempt to automatically create and install a Debian package containing the compiled ``numguesser`` and any necessary control info.
